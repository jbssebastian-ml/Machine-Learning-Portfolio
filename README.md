Hi, I’m Sebastian — an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer passionate about building intelligent systems that drive business automation and smarter decision-making.

I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with concentrations in Applied Statistics and Data Analytics at the University of St. Thomas. I’ve gained hands-on experience developing ML solutions, including:

* Artificial Neural Networks for regression tasks

* Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification

* Data cleaning and analysis pipelines

* End-to-end projects using Python, SQL, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and more

My goal is to create real-world impact through practical machine learning, whether that’s improving efficiency, predicting outcomes, or turning messy data into insights. I’m always learning and excited to grow in areas like MLOps, deep learning, and business-focused AI solutions.

This GitHub is where I document that journey — from early learning projects to production-level applications. Thanks for checking it out!

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or reach out if you’re working on something cool — I’m always open to learning and collaboration!
